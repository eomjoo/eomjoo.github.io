Why You Give Up Spring Learning
Many developers start studying spring because they need it in employment or practice. But when I start studying, the spring is so huge that I don't know where to start and how to learn. It feels like a sailboat that is lost in the middle of a wide everywhere and floats alone.
So far, I've seen a lot of developers who got lost and gave up in the middle of trying spring learning. This is because from the beginning, we learn from too theoretical content such as Inversion of Control (IoC) DI (Dependency Injection), AOP, etc.
Why should I study Spring? These fundamental questions come first. We need to learn springs to develop a web application that works well in practice.
