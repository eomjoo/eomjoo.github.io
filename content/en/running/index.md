# My Running Story 🏃

Since I was a child, I wasn't in great shape, so my PE teacher recommended that I start running. From then on, I enjoyed running while looking at the scenery, and I continue to enjoy running to this day.

## Tips 🏃‍♂️
- **Running Tips**: Jumping into running without a plan can reduce your interest in it. I recommend starting with light jogging around a place you like! After that, it's good to find your own routine.
- **Running Routine**: I run about 2-3 times a week, aiming to complete 5KM in 30 minutes.
