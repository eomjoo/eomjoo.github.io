Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language widely used for developing various applications. In this section, we'll cover the basics of Java syntax, its key features, and advanced technologies.

## Features of Java
- **Object-Oriented:** Java is designed based on the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing for easy maintenance and reusable code.
- **Platform Independence:** Programs written in Java can run on any operating system as they execute on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Memory Management:** Java automatically manages memory through garbage collection.
- **Security:** Java offers various security features, supporting the development of secure applications.
- **Extensive Libraries:** Java has a wide range of libraries and frameworks that enhance development productivity.

## Basic Syntax
The basic structure of a Java program is as follows. The program execution starts from the `main` method within a class.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Variables and Data Types
        System.out.println("\nBasic Syntax Example:");
        int number = 10;        // Integer
        double price = 19.99;   // Double
        char letter = 'A';      // Character
        boolean isJavaFun = true; // Boolean
        String text = "Java Programming"; // String

        System.out.println("Integer Variable: " + number);
        System.out.println("Double Variable: " + price);
        System.out.println("Character Variable: " + letter);
        System.out.println("Boolean Variable: " + isJavaFun);
        System.out.println("String Variable: " + text);

        // Conditional Statement Example
        System.out.println("\nConditional Statement Example:");
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("number is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("number is negative.");
        }

        // Loop Example
        System.out.println("\nLoop Example (Printing from 0 to 4):");
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + i);
        }

    }
}

```
