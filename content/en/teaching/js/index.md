JavaScript is the core language of web development, widely used for creating dynamic web applications and implementing server-side logic. In this section, we will explore the features, basic syntax, and applications of JavaScript.

## JavaScript의 특징
- **Dynamic Programming Language:** Supports dynamic typing where the variable's data type is determined at runtime.
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Provides powerful functionality for handling events, allowing the creation of interactive web applications.
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Effectively handles asynchronous operations through callbacks, Promises, and await
- **Cross-Platform:** Can be executed both in browsers and on the server (Node.js), making it versatile for various environments.
- **Rich Libraries and Frameworks:** Enhances development productivity with various frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery.

## Basic Syntax
The basic program structure of JavaScript is simple. You can write code directly in the browser's developer tools console or in an HTML file.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");

let number = 10;          // Number  
const price = 19.99;      // Constant  
let text = "JavaScript Programming"; // String  
let isJavaScriptFun = true; // Boolean  

// Conditional statement  
let number = 10;  
if (number > 0) {  
    console.log("number is positive.");  
} else {  
    console.log("number is negative.");  
}

// Loop  
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
    console.log(`Count: ${i}`);  
}  


```

### JavaScript Applications
- **Frontend Development:** You can build complex user interfaces using frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- **Backend Development:**  Write server-side logic and communicate with databases using Node.js. Examples: Node.js, Express.js.
